* I created PartySmart with the idea to have an app that helps you stay smarter when you have a night of drinking in store.

The formula used to calculate a person's blood alcohol content was Widmark's Formula: http://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-Blood-Alcohol-Content-(Widmark-Formula)



Future Plans for PartySmart: 
* Add two-way data-binding so that the user can decrease the number of drinks recorded
* Add formula to reverse calculate BAC so the user can know how many hours until BAC is under the legal limit
* Add ability to calculate different sizes/strengths of drink (ie pint of beer vs 12oz bottle of beer)
* Add disclaimer
* Improve mobile layout
* Add function to calculate various degrees of how much user can drink based on how hungover (or not hungover) user is willing to be
